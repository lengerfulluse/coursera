 * The finally block always executes when the try block exits. This ensures that the finally

 * exception handling â€” it allows the programmer to avoid having cleanup code accidentally
 * bypassed by a return, continue, or break. Putting cleanup code in a finally block is
 * always a good practice, even when no exceptions are anticipated.
